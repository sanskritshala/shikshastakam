            <h4>About Shikshashtakam :</h4>
            <p>Shikshastakam is a set of 8 verses composed by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu that express his teachings and
              philosophy in a concise and profound manner. These verses are considered to be one of his most important
              works and are highly revered by followers of the Gaudiya Vaishnavism tradition. The Shikshashtakam is
              important for several reasons. First, it provides a concise and accessible summary of Chaitanya
              Mahaprabhu's teachings, which emphasize the importance of devotional service to God and the practice of
              humility, compassion, and spiritual love. Second, the Shikshashtakam is renowned for its poetic beauty and
              literary excellence.The verses are characterized by their simplicity, clarity, and emotional depth, and
              are often compared to the works of great poets like Kalidasa and Jayadeva. In summary, the Shikshashtakam
              is an important work of devotional literature that embodies Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's teachings and
              philosophy in a poetic and highly evocative form. Its beauty and literary excellence have earned it a
              place among the great works of Sanskrit literature, and it continues to be revered and studied by scholars
              and devotees alike.

            Sanskrit poetry has played a significant role in shaping the literary and cultural landscape of the Indian
            subcontinent for centuries.
            However, not much attention has been devoted to uncovering the hidden beauty in Sanskrit poetry.
            This work explores the intersection of Sanskrit poetry and computational linguistics by proposing a roadmap
            of an interpretable framework to classify and
            analyze Sanskrit poetry into levels of the best composition. We discuss the rich tradition of Sanskrit
            poetry and the significance of computational linguistics
            in identifying the best poetry automatically. We also identify 5 computational challenges involved in this
            process,
            including subjectivity, complex language use, cultural context, lack of large labeled datasets, and
            multi-modality.
            The proposed framework involves a human-in-the-loop approach that combines deterministic aspects delegated
            to machines and deep semantics left to human experts.

          <p>
            We provide a deep analysis of Shikshashtakam, a Sanskrit poem, from the perspective of 6 prominent Kavya
            shastra schools to illustrate the proposed framework.
            Additionally, we provide compound, dependency, anvaya (prose order linearised form), meter, rasa (mellow),
            alamkara (figure of speech), and reeti (writing style)
            annotations for Shikshashtakam and a web application to illustrate the poem's analysis and annotations.
            The paper's key contributions include the proposed framework, the analysis of Shikshashtakam, the
            annotations and
            the web application.
            We aim to bridge the gap between Kavya shastra and computational methods and pave the way for future
            research in this area.

        <div class="subsection__content">
          <p>Kavya Shastra is the traditional Indian science of poetics and literary criticism, which has played a
            significant role in shaping the development of literature and
            aesthetics in the Indian subcontinent for over two thousand years. The term "Kavya" refers to poetry or
            literature, while "Shastra" means
            science or knowledge, and Kavya Shastra is thus the systematic study of the nature, forms, and principles of
            poetry and literature.
            The roots of Kavya Shastra can be traced back to ancient India, where it developed alongside other branches
            of learning such as philosophy, grammar, and rhetoric.
            Over time, Kavya Shastra evolved into a complex and sophisticated system of literary theory, encompassing a
            wide range of concepts and techniques for analyzing and appreciating poetry, such as rasa (the emotional
            essence of poetry), alamkara (the use of rhetorical and figurative devices), dhvani (the power of
            suggestion), Vakrokti (oblique), Auchitya (appropriateness) and riti (the appropriate use of style and
            language).
            Following table gives a brief overview of these 6 schools in chronological order with founder acharya, their
            treatise and objectives.</p>
